Hello! I'm Midas! I've been a software engineer since 2001, primarily building websites and browser-based applications and games. I graduated Georgia Tech as a Computational Media major in 2009 and since then I've worked in the games industry in Seattle, the chaotic startup world in Miami, and fully remote since 2017.

 * ~multiplayer fantasy RPG~
 * ~text-only MUD~
 * ~space idle~
 * ~arcade space shooter~
 * ~arcade 4X space combat~
 * ~multiplayer procedural roguelike~
 * ~bee-themed conquest~
 * open-world space exploration arcade
 
 game, and I'm endlessly learning how to do things better.
